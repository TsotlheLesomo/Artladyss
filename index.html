          <h2></h2>
          <p>The importance of art is an important topic and has been debated for many years. Some might think art is not as important as other disciplines like science or technology. Some might ask what art is able to offer the world in terms of evolution in culture and society, or perhaps how can art change us and the world. This article aims to explore these weighty questions and more. So, why is art important to our culture? Let us take a look.</p>
          <p>Art does not need to explain in words how someone feels â€“ it only shows. Almost anyone can create something that conveys a message on a personal or public level, whether it is political, social, cultural, historical, religious, or completely void of any message or purpose. Art becomes a universal language for all of us to tell our stories; it is the ultimate storyteller.</p>

            <p>When it comes to making art, the whole point is to show rather than tell. After all, a picture is supposed to be worth 1,000 words, so it's no suprise that most artists prefer to leave the talking to their work. But that doesn't mean artists never say what's on their minds.</p>
