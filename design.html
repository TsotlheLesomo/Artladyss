          </h1>
          <p>Creativity is one of the most prestigious ideas of modern times and as a result, we often want to feel creative while lamenting that our lives don’t give us sufficient opportunities to be so. But this impression may come down to an unfairly inflated and unhelpfully skewed notion of what creativity could actually involve. We are far too focused on creativity’s dramatic highpoints within a narrow, cliched band of activities, like the writing of a prize-winning novel or the making a film that receives accolades at the Makgadikgadi salt pans or teh Tsodilo hills. By this standard, almost no-one can be creative and creativity must remain an elite and even freakish anomaly entirely disconnected from ordinary life. Being an artist of any kind can be hard work. Harder than most people who don’t consider themselves artists assume. And that even goes for art journalers, who make art only for themselves, in their private art journals. So artists, art journalers, and any other creative who sometimes struggles making art are given the opportunity to showcase their creativity on our blog.
